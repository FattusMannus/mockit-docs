Sometimes when you work on applications you need an API to hit and get some data from. Developers have a few options for this, they seem to either stub out the API with JSON files, create a mock API themselves to hit whilst the “real” one is being developed or they just want until the backend API is ready to be consumed.

MockIt was designed and developed to help developers get off the ground faster, and give developers a quick way to create APIS for their applications whilst “real” ones are being worked on.

MockIt was built as a proof of concept to help developers quickly create end points that were not just JSON stubs in their applications. Hopefully MockIt can be helpful to some developers out there that just want a quick API that is easy to manage.
